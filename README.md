# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis, Retiring employees and  mentorship program.

## 1. Overview of the analysis

This is the challenge activity for the module 7 of the Data Analytics and Visualization Boot Camp of the university of Texas at Austin.
The main idea is to apply the learned skills of Structured Query Language (SQL).

The project  was based on data of about  331 ,000 employees of the company Pewlett-Hackard.
The main objective of the analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.


## 2. Results:

###Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title

First a ERD was created to understand the  structure of the data. See image above.

First step: SQL queries,  I created the Retirement Titles table  shown above.
This table holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955


### Deliverable 2 Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

I used input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, 
then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

### Deliverable 3 Create a Travel Itinerary Map
I used the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations.
Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.

## 3. Summary: 

This was a  very interesting challenge where I had the opportunity to discover and use the APIs.
I see a big opportunity and I believe this will be very useful
